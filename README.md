# Digital Evidence Pipeline (DEP)

**Forensic-grade DevOps compliance monitoring applying 15 years of DNA laboratory chain-of-custody principles to infrastructure.**

## 🎯 The Forensic Difference

**Traditional Monitoring**: "The system went down at 2 AM"  
**Forensic Monitoring**: "Here's cryptographic proof of the complete system state, with tamper-evident chain of custody"

This working system demonstrates how forensic science principles create audit trails for DevOps infrastructure.
